    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science student at Drexel University graduating in 2027 with a focus on AI, full-stack development, and hardware integration. 
      I love building things that solve real problemsâ€”from machine learning applications to hands-on mechanical builds. 
      I was born in Brooklyn, NY, but really I grew up outside of Philadelphia in Lansdale, PA. 
      My passion for technology started early because I've always been a tech guy. 
      Outside of tech, I love traveling, volunteering, and hanging out with friends and family. 
      Hanging out is really just me and my friends playing sports, eating out, or having poker nights. 
      Some of my favorite foods are chicken roast with Bengali-style pulao., Wingstop chicken tenders, lamb shawarma, and cheesesteaks.
      I also love to scroll on Tiktok. Not saying I'm brainrotted, I just love watching informational and historical videos. 
      My dream is to go to Japan and experience the culture, technology, and food firsthand. I also want to explore all of Europe, especially the UK, France, Greece and Italy.
      Iâ€™m always open to connecting. You can reach me at 267-467-3865 or email me at rmj77@drexel.edu.

  <h2>My Builds</h2>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Modded Coleman CT200U</h3>
    <img src="images/coleman.JPG" alt="Coleman" class="project-image" style="width: 50%;">
    <p>
      Parts:
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Predator 212cc engine</li>
        <li>Mikuni VM22 Carburetor (22mm)</li>
        <li>Centrifugal Clutch</li>
        <li>#40 Chain</li>
        <li>Exhaust (left-side mounted, curved over to right-side exit)</li>
        <li>Hydraulic Brake Lever</li>
        <li>Headlight</li>
      </ul>
      This build features a performance-focused setup with a Mikuni 22mm carburetor for smoother throttle response and power delivery. The exhaust system is custom-mounted starting on the left and sweeping over to the right for a unique look and improved clearance. Hydraulic brakes ensure better stopping power for off-road use. I am also trying to convince my friend to get it DMV approved by adding a title to it. All he would need to do is install turn signals and get PENNDOT-approved tires.
      While I could push this build for even higher speeds, I value my life since these machines aren't street legal and are best kept to controlled environments.
    </p>
    <p>Both the governor limiter and stock flywheel were removed and replaced with a billet aluminum flywheel, increasing torque and allowing for higher RPMs. With these Stage 2 modifications, the bike can reach realistic top speeds of approximately 50-55 mph depending on gearing and terrain.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Custom Quad</h3>
    <img src="images/atv.jpeg" alt="Quad" class="project-image" style="width: 50%;">
    <p>
      Parts:
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Predator 301cc engine welded to frame</li>
        <li>Mikuni VM26 Carburetor (26mm)</li>
        <li>3/4 inch Torque Converter</li>
        <li>Center-mounted Exhaust</li>
        <li>Shock Absorber</li>
        <li>Hydraulic Brakes (Front & Rear)</li>
        <li>Headlight</li>
      </ul>
      This custom-built quad features a Predator 301cc engine welded directly to the frame for maximum durability. It uses a Mikuni VM26 carburetor for enhanced power and throttle response, and a center-mounted exhaust for balanced performance. With hydraulic brakes on both the front and rear and a fully functional suspension, it's built for aggressive off-road use while maintaining reliability.
    </p>
    <p>Similar to the Coleman, I removed the engine's governor limiter and upgraded to a billet flywheel for enhanced torque and top-end speed. With the Stage 2 build, this quad is capable of reaching around 55-60 mph while maintaining strong off-road acceleration. I also plan to add a speaker system to the quad for music during rides, and unlike the Coleman, this build has the potential to be DMV approved with the right modifications for road use.</p>
