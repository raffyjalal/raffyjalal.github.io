    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science student at Drexel University graduating in 2027 with a focus on AI, full-stack development, and hardware integration. I love building things that solve real problemsâ€”from machine learning applications to hands-on mechanical builds. Outside of tech, Iâ€™m passionate about playing basketball, hanging out with friends, and doing mukbangsâ€”I once ate 100 Popeyes nuggets in under an hour. I love spicy food (Iâ€™m Bengali, of course) and think Indian cuisine is hands down the bestâ€”my favorites are butter chicken or traditional roast. I live in Lansdale, PA and Iâ€™m always open to connecting. You can reach me at 267-467-3865 or email me at rmj77@drexel.edu.

  <h2>My Builds</h2>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Modded Coleman CT200U</h3>
    <img src="images/coleman.JPG" alt="Coleman" class="project-image" style="width: 50%;">
    <p>
      Parts:
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Predator 212cc engine</li>
        <li>Mikuni VM22 Carburetor (22mm)</li>
        <li>Centrifugal Clutch</li>
        <li>#40 Chain</li>
        <li>Exhaust (left-side mounted, curved over to right-side exit)</li>
        <li>Hydraulic Brake Lever</li>
        <li>Headlight</li>
      </ul>
      This build features a performance-focused setup with a Mikuni 22mm carburetor for smoother throttle response and power delivery. The exhaust system is custom-mounted starting on the left and sweeping over to the right for a unique look and improved clearance. Hydraulic brakes ensure better stopping power for off-road use. I am also trying to convince my friend to get it DMV approved by adding a title to it. All he would need to do is install turn signals and get PENNDOT-approved tires.
      While I could push this build for even higher speeds, I value my life since these machines aren't street legal and are best kept to controlled environments.
    </p>
    <p>Both the governor limiter and stock flywheel were removed and replaced with a billet aluminum flywheel, increasing torque and allowing for higher RPMs. With these Stage 2 modifications, the bike can reach realistic top speeds of approximately 50-55 mph depending on gearing and terrain.</p>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Custom Quad</h3>
    <img src="images/atv.jpeg" alt="Quad" class="project-image" style="width: 50%;">
    <p>
      Parts:
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Predator 301cc engine welded to frame</li>
        <li>Mikuni VM26 Carburetor (26mm)</li>
        <li>3/4 inch Torque Converter</li>
        <li>Center-mounted Exhaust</li>
        <li>Shock Absorber</li>
        <li>Hydraulic Brakes (Front & Rear)</li>
        <li>Headlight</li>
      </ul>
      This custom-built quad features a Predator 301cc engine welded directly to the frame for maximum durability. It uses a Mikuni VM26 carburetor for enhanced power and throttle response, and a center-mounted exhaust for balanced performance. With hydraulic brakes on both the front and rear and a fully functional suspension, it's built for aggressive off-road use while maintaining reliability.
    </p>
    <p>Similar to the Coleman, I removed the engine's governor limiter and upgraded to a billet flywheel for enhanced torque and top-end speed. With the Stage 2 build, this quad is capable of reaching around 55-60 mph while maintaining strong off-road acceleration. I also plan to add a speaker system to the quad for music during rides, and unlike the Coleman, this build has the potential to be DMV approved with the right modifications for road use.</p>
